# The Complete 2022 Web-Development Bootcamp

This repository displays all projects completed during the "The Complete 2022 Web-Development Bootcamp" course. More on the course here: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp

This course covers HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, vanilla Javascript, JQuery, Git Bash, Github, Node.Js, Express.Js, APIs, EJS, Database fundamentals, SQL Databases, NoSQL Databases (+MongoDB&Mongoose), Deployment, RESTful APIs, React.js, Authentication and security and Blockchain development.

I plan on creating a main hub page which will allow a visitor to access all projects that will be completed throughout the course.
As my skills increase and the scope of the projects gets bigger, the final layout/functionality of the hub page will most likely change. In turn, this file will be updated to reflect such changes. I plan to have every project uploaded on a live page so that no installs are required.
